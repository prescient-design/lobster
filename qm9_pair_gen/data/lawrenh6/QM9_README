QM9 is a comprehensive dataset that provides geometric, energetic, electronic and thermodynamic properties for a subset of GDB-17 database, comprising 134 thousand stable organic molecules with up to 9 heavy atoms. All moleucles are modeled using density functional theory (B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) based DFT).

The data files:
qm9.sdf: molecular structures
qm9.sdf.csv: tables for molecular properties
	"mol_id" - Molecule ID (gdb9 index) mapping to the .sdf file
	"A" - Rotational constant (unit: GHz)
	"B" - Rotational constant (unit: GHz)
	"C" - Rotational constant (unit: GHz)
	"mu" - Dipole moment (unit: D)
	"alpha" - Isotropic polarizability (unit: Bohr^3)
	"homo" - Highest occupied molecular orbital energy (unit: Hartree)
	"lumo" - Lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (unit: Hartree)
	"gap" - Gap between HOMO and LUMO (unit: Hartree)
	"r2" - Electronic spatial extent (unit: Bohr^2)
	"zpve" - Zero point vibrational energy (unit: Hartree)
	"u0" - Internal energy at 0K (unit: Hartree)
	"u298" - Internal energy at 298.15K (unit: Hartree)
	"h298" - Enthalpy at 298.15K (unit: Hartree)
	"g298" - Free energy at 298.15K (unit: Hartree)
	"cv" - Heat capavity at 298.15K (unit: cal/(mol*K))
	"u0_atom" - Atomization energy at 0K (unit: kcal/mol)
	"u298_atom" - Atomization energy at 298.15K (unit: kcal/mol)
	"h298_atom" - Atomization enthalpy at 298.15K (unit: kcal/mol)
	"g298_atom" - Atomization free energy at 298.15K (unit: kcal/mol)
*"u0_atom" ~ "g298_atom" are calculated from the differences between "u0" ~ "g298" and sum of reference energies of all atoms in the molecules, as given in https://figshare.com/articles/Atomref%3A_Reference_thermochemical_energies_of_H%2C_C%2C_N%2C_O%2C_F_atoms./1057643
