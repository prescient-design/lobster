## Why you should use LBSTER <a name="why-use"></a>
* LBSTER is built for pre-training models quickly from scratch. It is "batteries included." This is most useful if you need to control the pre-training data mixture and embedding space, or want to experiment with novel pre-training objectives and fine-tuning strategies.
* LBSTER is a living, open-source library that will be periodically updated with new code and pre-trained models from the [Frey Lab](https://ncfrey.github.io/) at [Prescient Design, Genentech](https://www.gene.com/scientists/our-scientists/prescient-design). The Frey Lab works on real therapeutic molecule design problems and LBSTER models and capabilities reflect the demands of real-world drug discovery campaigns.
* LBSTER is built with [beignet](https://github.com/Genentech/beignet/tree/main), a standard library for biological research, and integrated with [cortex](https://github.com/prescient-design/cortex/tree/main), a modular framework for multitask modeling, guided generation, and multi-modal models.
* LBSTER supports concepts; we have a concept-bottleneck protein language model, CB-LBSTER, which supports 718 concepts.

## Install <a name="install"></a>

### Using `uv`
Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and create a new virtual environment:


```bash
uv venv --python 3.12  # create a new virtual environment in the `lobster` directory
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .
```

Alternatively, run installation directly with `uv sync`:
```bash
uv sync
uv sync --all-extras --no-cache  # to resolve flash-attn installation issues
```

and then prefix every command with `uv run`. For example,

```bash
uv run lobster_train data.path_to_fasta="test_data/query.fasta" 
```

### flash attention
To make use of [flash attention](https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention) install with the `flash` extra
```bash
uv sync --extra flash
```

### Using `mamba`
clone the repo, cd into it and do `mamba env create -f env.yml`
then from the root of the repo, do
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Loading a pre-trained model
```python
from lobster.model import LobsterPMLM, LobsterPCLM, LobsterCBMPMLM
masked_language_model = LobsterPMLM("asalam91/lobster_24M")
concept_bottleneck_masked_language_model = LobsterCBMPMLM("asalam91/cb_lobster_24M")
causal_language_model = LobsterPCLM.load_from_checkpoint(<path to ckpt>)
```
3D, cDNA, and dynamic models use the same classes.

**Models**
* LobsterPMLM: masked language model (BERT-style encoder-only architecture)
* LobsterCBMPMLM: concept bottleneck masked language model (BERT-style encoder-only architecture with a concept bottleneck and a linear decoder)
* LobsterPCLM: causal language model (Llama-style decoder-only architecture)
* LobsterPLMFold: structure prediction language models (pre-trained encoder + structure head)

## MCP Integration <a name="mcp-integration"></a>

Lobster supports [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) for seamless integration with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other AI tools:

```bash
# Install with MCP support
uv sync --extra mcp

# Setup Claude Desktop integration
uv run lobster_mcp_setup
```

### Setup for Cursor

#### Option 1: One-Click Install (Recommended)

[![Add Lobster to Cursor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Add%20to%20Cursor-MCP%20Server-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=cursor)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=lobster-inference&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjogInV2IiwgImFyZ3MiOiBbInJ1biIsICItLXByb2plY3QiLCAiLiIsICItLWV4dHJhIiwgIm1jcCIsICJsb2JzdGVyX21jcF9zZXJ2ZXIiXSwgImVudiI6IHt9LCAiY3dkIjogIiR7d29ya3NwYWNlRm9sZGVyfSJ9Cg==)

Click the button above to automatically add the Lobster MCP server to Cursor.

**Requirements:**
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/) installed
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager available in PATH  
- Lobster repository cloned locally with all dependencies installed (`uv sync --all-extras`)

After setup, you can use Lobster models directly in Claude Desktop or Cursor with natural language commands like:
- "Get embeddings for this protein sequence using lobster_24M"
- "What concepts are supported by the cb_lobster_24M model?"
- "Intervene on this sequence to reduce hydrophobicity"

**Key Features:**
- **Modular architecture** - Clean separation of models, tools, and schemas
- **Multiple model types** - Access to both MLM and concept bottleneck models
- **5 core tools** - Embeddings, concepts, interventions, naturalness, and model listing
- **Type-safe validation** - Pydantic schemas for reliable interactions

See the [MCP Integration Guide](docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md) for complete documentation or [MCP README](src/lobster/mcp/README.md) for quick start instructions.

#### Usage Examples

Once installed, you can use natural language commands in Claude Desktop:

```
What Lobster models are available for protein analysis?

```

#### Development

For developers who want to build and test DXT extensions locally:

```bash
# Build DXT extension locally
python scripts/build_dxt.py

# Create a release (updates version, builds, and creates GitHub release)
python scripts/release_dxt.py 0.1.0

## Example scripts

Check out [examples](examples/) for scripts showing how to perform inference and interventions.

## Training and inference <a name="training"></a>

### Embedding
The entrypoint `lobster_embed` is the main driver for embedding sequences and accepts parameters using Hydra syntax. The available parameters for configuration can be found by running `lobster_embed --help` or by looking in the src/lobster/hydra_config directory

To embed a fasta file of sequences using a pre-trained model on an interactive GPU node, cd into the root dir of this repo and do
```bash
lobster_embed data.path_to_fasta="test_data/query.fasta" checkpoint="path_to_checkpoint.ckpt"
```

This will generate a dataframe of embeddings and also log them to wandb.

### Regression and classification
For robust multitask modeling, we recommend using `lobster` with [cortex]((https://github.com/prescient-design/cortex/tree/main)). For simple baselines using `lobster` embeddings, use `lobster.model.LinearProbe` and `lobster.model.LobsterMLP`.

### Likelihoods
Likelihoods from an autoregressive `LobsterCLM` or pseudo-log likelihoods ("naturalness") from a `LobsterPMLM` can be computed for a list of `sequences` using

```python
model.naturalness(sequences)
model.likelihood(sequences)
```

### Training from scratch
The entrypoint `lobster_train` is the main driver for training and accepts parameters using Hydra syntax. The available parameters for configuration can be found by running `lobster_train --help` or by looking in the src/lobster/hydra_config directory

To train an MLM on a fasta file of sequences on an interactive GPU node, cd into the root dir of this repo and do
```bash
lobster_train data.path_to_fasta="test_data/query.fasta" logger=csv paths.root_dir="."
```

### Reinforcement Learning with UME Reward Functions <a name="rl-training"></a>

Lobster supports reinforcement learning training using UME-based reward functions for post-training language models. This approach uses UME pseudo-likelihood scores as rewards to guide model behavior toward generating more biologically plausible sequences.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Step 1: Generate synthetic dataset
cd examples
python generate_synthetic_dataset.py

# Step 2: Run UME-based GRPO training
python train_ume_grpo.py
```

**Key Features:**
- **Automatic modality detection** for SMILES, amino acid, and DNA sequences
- **UME-based reward functions** using pseudo-likelihood scores
- **GRPO training** with TRL integration
- **Modular design** with reusable components

For detailed instructions and advanced usage, see the [RL Training Guide](docs/RL_TRAINING.md).
